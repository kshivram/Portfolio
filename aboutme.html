<h2> About Me </h2>
  
<p> My name is Kavita, and I am a rising junior in highschool, aspiring to learn new things about all things technology and coding! I like puppies and
 writing in my leisure time. Some of my dislikes include being restricted in my ability to express ideas freely, as well as people who chew gum loudly.
 A fun fact about me </p>
