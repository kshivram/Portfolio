<p> My name is Kavita, and I am a rising junior in highschool, aspiring to learn new things about all things technology and coding! I like listening to music and
 writing in my leisure time. Some of my dislikes include being restricted in my ability to express ideas freely, as well as people who chew gum loudly.
 A fun fact about me is that I am actually in the process of learning Ancient Greek at my school.  </p>

    <p> There are a variety of similarities between Scratch and Python. For example, loops and variables can be utilized to simplify a function. Also, 
      different colors cand styles can be utilized. However, unlike Scratch, Python is much easier to navigate, because instead of searching through different menus to find different functions, you can just 
      type out the code.

    <p> I definitely spent time debugging my program, aa there were errors involving the code ranging from indentation errors or syntax errors. It 
      felt nice to have the ability to fix my own mistakes to perfect my code, giving me a sense of accomplishment. Thus, I had a sense of self-accomplishment from 
     fixing these errors. It was slightly hard to some extent, because it was frustrating having to edit the code I have been working hard on.
